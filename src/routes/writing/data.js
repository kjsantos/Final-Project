					<br /><br />BOSTON – Not all neighborhoods are created equal when it comes to how the city responds to building violations.

					<br /><br />According to data from the Boston Public Works Department, which is updated daily, nearly 2,000 building and property code violations remain open throughout the city. The majority of open violations exist in neighborhoods with lower median income and higher minority populations, such as Dorchester, Roxbury and East Boston.

					<br /><br />Of the mapped violations, frequent occurrences include unsafe and dangerous structure notices, as well as extermination requests. The disparities in maintenance quality paint a picture of how different neighborhoods might be treated with varying urgency, resulting in some of the areas with higher amounts of open violations neglected for as much as five years.

					<br /><br />This interactive heat map shows how many violations exist per neighborhood:</p>`,

		BOSTON — In 1952, the news team at CBS used a computer the size of a room to successfully predict the results of the U.S. presidential election using poll data. Over half a century later, Charleston Gazette-Mail reporter Eric Eyre used data that drove his narrative covering the rampant opioid epidemic in West Virginia—work that won him the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in investigative journalism.

<br /> Eyre obtained data from the Drug Enforcement Agency and Centers for Disease Control for his 2016 piece. From the data, he discovered that drug firms poured over 780 million opioid pills in West Virginia over a six-year period. Eyre also mapped overdose data in a visual aid showing the differences in overdose concentration by region.
<br /> 
<br /> Modern society lives in an era many have declared “the information age.” In times like these, data has the potential to explain more than humanly possible 20 years ago. Over the last two decades, advancements in digital storage have changed the rate at which people access information. The amount of data in the world is growing faster by the minute, as is the number of tools to handle it. And journalists happen to be the unsung heroes fit to wield those tools.
<br /> 
<br /> In simple terms, datasets are organized spreadsheets containing information. Once data is organized, it can be studied for hidden trends and patterns. Journalists who look for data in the lesser-sought places uncover some of the most groundbreaking material in modern news. In fact, the Boston Globe’s 2003 Spotlight article used court records to expose the Catholic church’s sexual misconduct settlements.
<br /> 
<br /> Data helps point reporters in the right direction while investigating, said Todd Wallack, an investigative reporter and data journalist for the Boston Globe. “Public records are really important; they are a critical tool for getting good stories and reporting them out,” he said.
<br /> 
<br /> Wallack has been a Pulitzer Prize finalist three times throughout his career and is a proponent of using coding languages like Python and R to analyze datasets he has acquired through public records requests. Public records come in many forms and are accessible in order to keep people informed about government affairs and practices. Datasets such as city health inspections, nursing board disciplines, and police arrest records are all available to the public, and as government bodies collect more data, journalists are more likely to learn new information from them.
<br /> 
<br /> But the use of data in journalism can also do harm, especially because false information is relayed just as quickly as true facts. Visualization, or the creation of representative charts, graphs, or other aids to help communicate data, is often misused by reporters purposely misrepresenting data, even if the data doesn’t accurately represent the point they are attempting to convey.
<br /> 
<br /> In 2013, Fox News came under fire for using misleading graphs in its reporting. One of the first rules in visualizing data using bar graphs is to make sure the y-axis starts at zero so differences in the data are represented proportionally. Fox disobeyed this rule when it showed a bar graph comparing southwest border apprehensions over time. The increase in illegal immigrant arrests from 165,233 in 2011 to 192,298 in 2013 is a mere 16 percent increase. However, the y-axis starts at 150,000 apprehensions and ends at 200,000, causing the 2013 bar to appear three times as large as the bar in 2011. People typically perceive things visually, so our minds can be swayed by misleading visualizations like Fox’s.
<br /> 
<br /> For aspiring journalists looking to master data, the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting has several tip sheets and listservs for writers looking to learn the best data reporting practices. The institute also offers week-long boot camps where amateur reporters can lea<br /> rn from veterans in the field. NICAR encourages reporters of all backgrounds to experiment with data and to have fun doing so.
“Any reporter can find a way to use data in their storytelling,” said Charles Minshew, director of data services at NICAR. “If you haven’t worked with data before, you can find something fun—sports statistics, for example—that is quantifiable, and just play around with the numbers.”
<br /> 
<br /> Despite the emerging influence of data literacy in journalism, there is still minimal urgency to teach computer assisted reporting at major universities. Charles Berret and Cheryl Phillips conducted a study on journalism curriculum for their 2016 book, Teaching Data and Computational Journalism. According to the study, which surveyed 113 university journalism programs in the U.S., schools only offer 1.4 classes in data journalism on average.
<br /> 
<br /> “Even as some universities add classes in web development and coding, they have not kept pace with offering courses in computer-assisted reporting skills like learning how to analyze and understand data,” Phillips and Berret say.
<br /> 
<br />Amid the current political atmosphere in the U.S., people are becoming disillusioned with both the government and the press. Data may be the only remedy to such unease; when handled with care, it can reshape the relations between the people, the government, and the press using hard, indisputable facts. As high schools and colleges integrate more data science courses, it is likely we will see an extension of those practices to data reporting and the future watchdogs of society.</p>`,

		content: `<br/><p class="blog">BOSTON — New York-based band Crumb blends styles to create an infectious sound that is at once unique and familiar. The four-piece consists of Lila Ramani, Jesse Brotter, Jonathan Gilad, and Brian Aronow, all of whom met while attending Tufts, and they released their self-titled EP in September. The Beat’s Kailen Santos met up with the band after their performance at Paige Hall on Tufts’ campus a few weeks ago and got the scoop about what’s new and what’s in store for Crumb fans in the future.
 
<br /><br /><br /><b>Kailen:</b>	What is it like to be back playing at Tufts? Is this the first show you’ve performed here as Crumb?
<br /><br /><b>Lila Ramani:</b>	It’s kind of weird to be completely honest [laughs]. But it was pretty cool, it’s just interesting because we were all in another band called Bad and Blue, which was like, a Tufts band. So we’ve played in this place a bunch of times and a lot of people knew us, but this was definitely different, and it is the first as Crumb.
<br /><br /><b>Jesse Brotter:</b>	The space is interesting because it’s super warm and boomy, which is usually a bad thing for sound, but I think [Lila’s] delay was doing really cool things off the walls.
<br /><br /><b>Brian Aronow:</b>	I still go here so it’s pretty weird; I feel like I’m coming back but I’m not, I’ve got class on Mondays and Wednesdays [laughs].
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	You have a few gigs coming up, a couple in New York and some around the Boston area; Is it difficult managing the time between both cities?
<br /><br /><b>BA:</b>	We’re pretty much in constant communication over text, but we’ll miss some subtle things; like, we didn’t know [Jesse and Lila] were coming last night, but they called us at 12:30 a.m. to come let them in. And it’s tough because every time we get together, we have to work off some rust because it’s usually been a couple weeks since we last played, so we’re really excited—I graduate in May and we’ll be planning a little summer tour. Hopefully [Jon & I will] move to New York by the end so we’re all in the same spot.
<br /><br /><b>LR:</b>	It’s on record!
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	You’ve played shows in both Boston and NY; are there any noticeable differences between the two cities?
<br /><br /><b>Jonathan Gilad:</b>	I don’t think we’ve really played enough shows around Boston to say there’s a scene here or there, but New York is just way bigger.
<br /><br /><b>LR:</b>	I really did like that show at the ER though – I think that was one of my favorite shows.
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	We’d definitely love to have you more in Boston. There are a ton of Crumb fans here!
<br /><br /><b>JG:</b>	It’s really bizarre, because we’re split up so we don’t get together that much. And there’s this storm on the internet that makes it seem like we do; it’s just like two different worlds and it’s hard to make sense of.
<br /><br /><b>BA:</b>	When we started the project, we didn’t really expect anything. Last year, we would meet up at this practice space in Central Square, and our goal was just to finish the 3 songs that are on the EP and record in April. Everyone was about to graduate and move to New York.
<br /><br /><b>JB:</b>	It looked like a real dead end.
<br /><br /><b>BA:</b>	And then we put it out and we’ve kind of just been riding the course right now.
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	How did you connect with Citrus City Records about the Crumb EP tape reissue?
<br /><br /><b>JB:</b>	Yo, they just contacted us.
<br /><br /><b>LR:</b>	All our shit has basically been people contacting us, like at gmail. For the music video we just put out, the guy was originally in contact with us via Soundcloud. I don’t know how typical that is.
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	That music video for “Bones” is sweet by the way, was that a local director?
<br /><br /><b>JB:</b>	New York actually, that was Haoyan of America. He’s got like the most amazing little vision and he uses you as the film crew and he uses anyone around who can help out. We were also subjected to some crazy shit. Some unseen footage involves dinosaur suits and–
<br /><br /><b>JB&BA:</b>	Tootsie rolls.
<br /><br /><b>JG:</b>	He’s such a mystery.
<br /><br /><b>BA:</b>	Yeah, he sees the world in a different way.
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	You mentioned that there would be some new songs on the EP reissue. Did you record those since the EP released?
<br /><br /><b>JB:</b>	Well actually, we’re doing another EP separate from our first EP reissue that Citrus City is making tapes of. So we just recorded our second EP and we’re working on it now.
<br /><br /><b>BA:</b>	Yeah, it’s some of the stuff you heard tonight.
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	Are there any other local names from Boston or New York you’d like to shout-out in the Beat?
<br /><br /><b>JB:</b>	Ian Sweet is really sick.
<br /><br /><b>LR:</b>	Yeah, we’re gonna do a show with them soon hopefully. I really like that band Blau Blau that played with us at the ER too.
<br /><br /><b>BA:</b>	Yeah, they just put out their EP also.
<br /><br /><b>LR:</b>	There’s this rap crew in New York called Slums that Jesse plays with – they’re dope.
<br /><br /><b>KS:</b>	Any last things you want to share with the fans?
<br /><br /><b>JB:</b>	Super corny, but I think it’s hard to see your own musical creation as outside of yourself; so it’s amazing to see people genuinely connecting to it in the same way you connect to other music. And people are so vocal to us, like on a daily basis there’s just the sweetest wordings in our inbox. You could literally be fucking up your day and then someone would be making a cartoon with your lyrics on it (pointing to Lila), it’s just awesome.
<br /><br /><b>LR:</b>	This girl said she was going to do a cover of “Bones” and record it, so that’s crazy.
<br />
<br />You can order the limited pink brick cassette reissue of the Crumb EP on Bandcamp now, or you can find the album on Spotify and Soundcloud. Stay tuned for Crumb’s next EP, coming out soon.</p>`,
